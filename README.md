cordova-plugin-oauth
====================

This plugin provides a mechanism for showing an OAuth flow in a secured system-provided browser view and receiving the result via a Message event.


Installation
------------

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-oauth
```


Supported Platforms
-------------------

* **iOS** (cordova-ios >= 5.0.0)
* **Android** (cordova-android >= 8.0.0)


Usage
-----

1. Trigger the plugin by opening the OAuth login page in a new window, with a window name that includes `"oauth:"`:

  ```javascript
  Window.open('https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?....', 'oauth:google', '');
  ```

  By default, the plugin registers the app ID as a scheme to be used as the OAuth callback URL, and expects a host of `oauth_callback`.
  i.e., if your app's ID is `com.example.foo`, your OAuth redirect URL should be `com.example.foo://oauth_callback`


2. The plugin will open the OAuth login page in a new browser window.

  On iOS, this uses ASWebAuthenticationSession on iOS 12 and newer, SFAuthenticationSession on iOS 11, SFSafariViewController on iOS 8 and newer, falling back to Safari.

  On Android, this uses Custom Tabs in the user's preferred web application, falling back to their browser.


3. When the OAuth process is complete and it redirects to your app scheme, the plugin will send a message to the Cordova app.

  The message begins with `oauth::` and is followed by a JSON object containing all of the key/value pairs from the OAuth redirect query string.

  ```javascript
  window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.data.match(/^oauth::/)) {
      var data = JSON.parse(event.data.substring(7));

      // Use data.code
    }
  }
  ```

The advantage of this implementation is that it can be made to work with Universal Links and App Links so that the same flow can be used in both mobile apps and web.
